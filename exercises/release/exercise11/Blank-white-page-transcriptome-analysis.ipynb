    "# Transcriptome analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "For this excercise, you have a dataset from a (fake) transcriptomics experiment. In this experiment, a tissue was surgically isolated from the surrounding body and submitted for single-cell sequencing. Typically, there are several cell types within such a tissue. Your job is to find out - using clustering on the RNA transcript count data - how many cell types were in the tissue. Use both *silhouette score* and *agglomerative clustering* to come up with an estimate of how many cell types were in the tissue. Please show your work. The dataset has 200 genes and is titled `RNAseq_data_200genes.csv`.\n",
